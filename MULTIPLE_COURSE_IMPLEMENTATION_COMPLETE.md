# Multiple Course Selection Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented multiple course selection functionality for the application form, allowing users to select multiple courses from the course finder and submit them as part of their application.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- **New Table**: `application_course_options`
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `application_id` - Foreign key to applications table
  - `country` - Course country
  - `city` - Course city/province
  - `college` - College/institution name
  - `course` - Course/program name
  - `course_type` - Type of course (Masters, Bachelors, etc.)
  - `fees` - Course fees
  - `duration` - Course duration
  - `college_detail_id` - Reference to external course finder system
  - `is_primary` - Boolean to mark the primary course choice
  - `priority_order` - Integer for course preference order
  - `timestamps` - Created/updated timestamps

### Models
- **New Model**: `ApplicationCourseOption`
  - Relationship with Application model
  - Fillable fields for mass assignment
  - Type casting for boolean and integer fields

- **Updated Model**: `Application`
  - Added `courseOptions()` relationship method
  - Eager loading in controller show method

### Backend Controller Logic
- **ApplicationController@store** updated to handle:
  - Multiple course options from `course_options[]` form array
  - Automatic primary course designation (first course)
  - Priority order assignment
  - Single course option creation for traditional form submissions
  - Country validation (all courses must be from same country)

### Frontend Implementation

#### Course Finder Integration
- Already supports multiple course selection
- Stores selected courses in localStorage as `selectedCoursesForApplication`
- Enforces same-country requirement for multiple selections
- Redirects to application form with multiple course data

#### Application Form Updates
- **Multiple Course Banner**: Shows when multiple courses are selected
- **Course Selection Section**: Displays and manages selected courses
- **JavaScript Functions**:
  - `handleMultipleCourseSelection()` - Loads courses from localStorage
  - `displaySelectedCourses()` - Renders course options in form
  - `addNewCourseOption()` - Allows adding additional course options
  - `removeCourseOption()` - Removes course options (minimum 1 required)
  - Auto-fills country field and makes it readonly for consistency

#### Application View Updates
- **Course Options Section**: Added to application show view
- Displays all course options with priority and primary designation
- Color-coded primary choice with special styling
- Responsive grid layout for course details

### Form Data Structure
The form now accepts `course_options[]` array with structure:
```php
course_options[0][country] = "Canada"
course_options[0][city] = "Toronto"
course_options[0][college] = "University of Toronto"
course_options[0][course] = "Computer Science Masters"
course_options[0][course_type] = "Masters"
course_options[0][fees] = "CAD 45,000"
course_options[0][duration] = "2 years"
course_options[0][college_detail_id] = "UOT-CS-001"
```

### Validation & Data Integrity
- All courses must be from the same country
- At least one course option required when using multiple selection
- Primary course designation for application data consistency
- Proper form validation and error handling

### User Experience Flow
1. User visits Course Finder
2. Selects multiple courses (same country requirement)
3. Clicks "Proceed to Application"
4. Application form auto-populates with course data
5. User can add/remove/edit course options
6. Country field locked to selected country
7. Form submission saves all course options
8. Application view displays all course preferences

## Testing
